Wendy,Haddad,Microsoft,Senior Cloud Solutions Architect Delivery Lead - Modern Work Technologies,"I had the privilege of supervising and mentoring Morgan Young during her first two semester internships at The Walt Disney Company.  I was impressed by Morgan’s professional demeanor and willingness to adapt to and learn from change.  Morgan was brought on as an engineering intern, but due to a project ending early, she was reassigned to me as a product management intern instead.  Despite having little knowledge of product management, Morgan enthusiastically threw herself into learning the field of product management.    I found Morgan to be thoughtful and eager to learn.  During our regular 1:1’s, Morgan always came prepared with questions.  We worked together to set professional goals for her internships and she worked diligently to meet and even exceed those goals during her time there.  I appreciated how teachable Morgan was.  She accepted feedback readily, implemented it where possible, and shared her journey and learnings with others.  Morgan has proven herself to be an excellent communicator - as equally comfortable communicating with senior executives as she is with her peers.  During her time, she worked on a variety of projects ranging from research, to product write-ups, to building applications, to managing pilots and change management, to building presentations.  She met each assignment on time and usually ahead of schedule and I appreciated the efficiency with which she completed her work while still maintaining a high standard.  She was able to take requests, refine the requirements, and deliver results.  I enjoyed working with Morgan and would highly recommend her for a product management role.","02/03/23, 05:25 AM",VISIBLE
