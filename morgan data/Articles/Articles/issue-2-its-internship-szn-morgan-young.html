At Disney, we have, what we call, "Cast Member Meet &amp; Greets," which are basically formalized coffee chats with our colleagues, leadership, and fellow interns. While your supervisor, manager, or mentor may set these up for you, it's important to be proactive in facilitating them on your own. And this isn't just limited to networking with full-time employees and leadership! I've made lifelong friends via the Disney Intern program!</p><p><br></p><p>2ï¸â£ <em>Learn as much as you can.</em></p><p>Most internships only last for 8-12 weeks, but there's still plenty that you can learn in that time! The key to maximizing your learning is by planning ahead. Before your internship starts, figure out what skills you want to improve and how you could improve them. Then, get on projects that will help you improve those skills. Secondly, most companies offer free learning resources, so take advantage of them!</p><p><br></p><p>3ï¸â£ <em>Stay busy!</em></p><p>I don't mean busy, like doing busywork. Some companies and managers are hesitant to give too much work to the intern since they don't want to "break the intern." ð It's perfectly normal, especially for companies or managers that have an intern for the first time. Advocate for yourself and let your leadership know if you want to take on more!</p><p><br></p><p>4ï¸â£ <em>Document everything. </em></p><p>Internships are pretty much the gateway to full-time jobs for college students, and it's so important to document your accomplishments! Keep a "brag book" of what you've achieved and don't forget to quantify it with metrics! Try to just write down 2-3 things each week that you feel were notable. At the end of your internship, this little "brag book" could help you get that raise, promotion, or more relevantly for interns, a return offer, full-time placement offer, or internship extension. Plus, it'll be perfect for creating bullet points for your resume! </p><p>ð¡ <em>Need help with your resume?</em> Check out THE resume and cover letter kit that got me my first internship with Disney as a freshman â <a href="https://morganyoung.gumroad.com/l/resume-coverletter-kit" target="_blank">https://morganyoung.gumroad.com/l/resume-coverletter-kit</a></p><p><br></p><p>5ï¸â£ <em>Take advantage of your intern benefits!</em></p><p>As an intern, you might have more access to benefits than you think. If you work for a large company, you'll probably be able to find a benefits overview workshop at the beginning of your internship. If not, you might have to do a little investigative work yourself. Taking advantage of my intern benefits brought me to Disneyland x11 and even on a Disney Cruise to the Bahamas!</p><div><hr></div><p>â¨ Don't forget to hit that Subscribe button and stay tuned for next week's edition!</p><p>ð Want to work with me?
