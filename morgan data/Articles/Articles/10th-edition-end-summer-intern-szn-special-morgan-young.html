  <div><p><strong>Welcome back, Zoomers!</strong></p><p><strong>Zooming to the Top </strong>is THE place for Gen Zs aka "Zoomers" to get insider secrets, tips, tricks, and insights on rising to the top of their careers.</p><p>It's almost the end of summer internship season üò≠.</p><p>A lot of you are probably close to wrapping up your internships or have already wrapped up your internships. And, for those who haven't graduated yet, it's almost time to start the fall semester! </p><p>The fall semester is a lot of things in terms of internships. Some of you might be chasing fall internship/co-op opportunities, and a lot of you will be beginning the application &amp; interview processes for Summer 2024 internships and full-time roles (for graduating seniors). </p><p>I know it's a lot üòÖ, but I'm going to try and cover as much of it as I can!! That said, if you have any questions about prepping for the fall semester in terms of career/internships or college, please leave a comment, send me a connection request with 'Zooming to the Top' + your question, or send me a message!</p><p>So with fall semester approaching, this week's article will be a "how-to"/"to-do" of things you should do to wrap up your summer internship, prepare for Fall 23/Spring 24/Summer 24 internship application cycles, and prepare for the fall semester. </p><p>We have a great opportunity roundup this week (pay attention to the spotlight section) and a few special announcements üòâ. </p><div><hr></div><h3>Announcements</h3><p><strong>One week after National Intern Day...</strong></p><p>Last week, I asked you all for your support in my run for <a target="_blank">WayUp</a> + <a target="_blank">Yello.co</a>'s Top 100 Interns of 2023. Thanks to all of YOU and the expert judging panel, not only did I make the coveted Top 100 list, <strong>I was named as THE Top Intern of 2023 üò≠!</strong></p><p>This is my last year as an intern, since I'll be graduating next spring. I've been wanting to get on WayUp's Top 100 Intern list since my first internship (2021). It was just something I kept talking myself out of. I'd tell myself that it was too big of a goal and it just wasn't realistic to expect it to happen. This year, one of my New Years resolutions was to "just go for it," with everything I've ever wanted and wanted to accomplish.</p><p>And lo and behold, it paid off!! Thank you so much to everyone for your votes and support; I literally could not have done this without all of you!! </p><p>I want to express my gratitude to the teams at WayUp and Yello for providing this amazing opportunity for interns and for selecting me for this incredible honor! üíù</p><p>I also want to extend a <strong>ü•≥ congratulations ü•≥</strong> to all of the other outstanding interns who made the Top 100 list, especially the Special Award winners ~</p><ul><li><a target="_blank">Christina Wang</a> - E&amp;S Casualty Intern at Arch Insurance Group</li><li><a target="_blank">Jack Uszynski</a> - Talent Management Intern at Comcast</li><li><a target="_blank">Damaryan Benton</a> - Public Relations Intern at Highwire PR</li><li><a target="_blank">Jackie Vargas</a> - Marketing Intern at KNB Communications</li><li><a target="_blank">Gwendolyn Williams</a> - Marketing Communications Intern at Indium Corp.</li></ul><div><hr></div><h3>This Week's Opportunity Roundup:</h3><blockquote><strong>Spotlight</strong></blockquote><ul><li><a target="_blank">Girls Who Invest</a>'s <a href="https://www.girlswhoinvest.org/sip" target="_blank">Summer Intensive Program</a> 2024; for sophomores, Early Action deadline is September 15, 2023, and Regular Decision deadline is November 1, 2023. </li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3648044658" target="_blank">Launch@Apple Mentorship and Externship Opportunities</a> at <a target="_blank">Apple</a> in Cupertino, CA.

Review the notes from your internship, your executive summaries, and presentations; use these to create new bullet points for your resume. </p><p>2Ô∏è‚É£<strong> Schedule last minute coffee chats! </strong>You've made so many good connections, friendships, and relationships throughout this internship! Don't forget to schedule some time to say farewell, and get alternative contact info to stay in touch, even after your internship is over.</p><p>3Ô∏è‚É£ <strong>Ask for recommendations</strong> on your LinkedIn profile from your manager, supervisor, colleagues, and co-workers. To request a recommendation from a particular person, go to their LinkedIn profile, click the "More" button, and select "Request a Recommendation."</p><p>4Ô∏è‚É£ <strong>Ask about extensions &amp; return offers!</strong> Yes, these are both possible! The first step to getting either of these is making the ask. The worst that you can get is a no. ü§∑üèª And if you do get a no, don't take it personally. Sometimes, it's not a reflection of your work, but a reflection of budget, head count, and logistics.</p><p>5Ô∏è‚É£ <strong>Make a LinkedIn post</strong> reflecting on your internship! This allows other people to get visibility into all of the amazing work that you did, AND lets potential employers know that you're back on the market üòâ. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>üåü Preparing for Fall Recruiting Season</strong></p><p><strong>1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a timeline</strong> of all of your internship application deadlines. This can be tough since not all job postings include an explicit deadline. However, you can usually see when the job was posted. As a rule of thumb, most super-competitive internships have an application window of ONE week. So, if it was posted on August 10, you should probably apply by August 17, if not right away. </p><p>2Ô∏è‚É£ <strong>Keep track of your applications</strong> as you apply and interview. Once you get past 50 or so applications, it starts getting a little blurry ü•¥. You'll want to keep track of the job posting (the link, company, and title), the application deadline, what stage of the process you're at, and your outcomes (rejected/offered). If you don't want to start from scratch, check out my <a href="https://morganyoung.gumroad.com/l/intern-app-tracker" target="_blank">internship application tracker</a>!</p><p>3Ô∏è‚É£ <strong>Optimize that resume!</strong> If you don't know where to start with this, check out my <a href="https://topmate.io/morganyoung/272692" target="_blank">resume + cover letter kit</a> (which includes the OG resume that got me my very first internship with Disney as a freshman)! Optimize your resume for the ATS using tools like <a target="_blank">Resume Worded</a> and <a target="_blank">Jobscan</a>. If you need help generating new bullet points, check out <a target="_blank">ResumAI by Wonsulting</a>!</p><p>4Ô∏è‚É£<strong> Practice interviewing.</strong> There's multiple ways to practice, both for technical and non-technical/behavioral interviews. For technical interviews, there's multiple resources online (i.e. the HackerRanks and LeetCodes of the world). For behavioral interviews, try to mimic the exact situation you're going to be in for your interview. If you're doing an in-person interview, do it with a friend. Dress up like you would for the interview and have them ask you relevant questions. If you're doing it virtually, conduct it on Zoom or Google Meet. </p><p>5Ô∏è‚É£ Remember to <strong>take a break!</strong> In any job market, the job hunt is a marathon, not a sprint (especially for early career). Allow yourself to take a break every now and then from applying and interviewing. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>üåü Prepare for the Fall Semester</strong></p><p><strong>1Ô∏è‚É£ Finalize your class schedule</strong>. If you've got priority registration, you've probably already register for your classes. Do some last minute checks against your degree requirements (which you can usually find in your university catalog) and double check RateMyProfessor. Some big sister advice üíå ~ the teacher is capable of making or breaking the class and your grade; do your due diligence. </p><p>2Ô∏è‚É£ <strong>Get your toolbox together</strong>. Everyone has their own way of taking notes, doing research, studying for exams, and completing assignments. Personally, my toolbox consists of ~ <a target="_blank">GoodNotes</a> for any class that involves a lot of equations, <a target="_blank">Notion</a> for anything involving documentation of code, and <a target="_blank">Google</a> Docs for writing assignments. (FYI: none of these are sponsored, these are ACTUAL tools I use. But hey GoodNotes, Notion and Google, if you DO want to explore a partnership with an early careers/college-focused creator, HMU, my DMs are open üëÄ).</p><p>3Ô∏è‚É£ <strong>Plan, plan, plan</strong>. I don't just mean homework, projects, and work (if you have a job). During the semester, school and work can be pretty overwhelming, especially if you're doing both. Make it easier on yourself but getting rid of things to worry about i.e. gym, meals, appointments, and paying bills. Have a gym schedule, prep your meals on Sunday, have appointments (one-offs and recurring) pre-planned out over the entire semester, and have your bills on auto-pay. Trust me, when you're in the middle of exams and capstone projects, you don't want to be worried about your rent being on time. </p><p>4Ô∏è‚É£ <strong>Map out your assignments</strong> and stay ahead of the curve. Not every class or professor will give you the run-down on the entire semester on day 1; make a plan with whatever is available to you. Specifically, take note of deadlines for major, long-term projects and big exams (midterms and final exams). </p><p>5Ô∏è‚É£ <strong>Have FUN! </strong>College is an amazing, fun-filled experience, if you let it be! Don't forget to take time between studies, work, and sleep to have some fun! In the first couple weeks of school, you'll find me with my friends &amp; boyfriend at the annual Undie Run for charity, our welcome week concert, and our home football games. Go Wolf Pack! üê∫</p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Connect with Me!</strong></h3><p>‚ú® Get in touch with me or book a 1:1 with me <a href="https://topmate.io/morganyoung" target="_blank">here</a>!</p><p>üîó Check out my <a href="https://www.morgan-ashleigh.com/" target="_blank">website</a>!</p><p>üí° <a href="https://morganyoung.gumroad.com/" target="_blank">Career Resources</a> from yours truly</p><p>üòÅ Don't forget to hit that Subscribe button and stay tuned for next week's edition!</p></div>
