Estée Lauder Website Design Challenge,"This project was an assignment for the above-mentioned Kode with Klossy Camp (2020). The project prompt was to redesign a pre-built web page using CSS. The prompt was to redesign the website to create a smoother and more attractive User Interface and User Experience. The project was completed using HTML5 and CSS, using repl.it as a workspace. We also had to incorporate design principles that we had learned during instruction such as color psychology and image positioning. My goal for the project was to not only view the project from a web developer perspective, but also from a marketing and sales perspective. I wanted to not only create a smoother User Experience and more attractive User Interface, but also create a website that would motivate the user to take action (in this case, buy the products showcased). A couple of things I did to create such a website were superimposing the words that were the primary focus of the page and positioning the titles and photos cohesively to tell a story (a story that would sell).

Combating Climate Change,"This project was an assignment for the above-mentioned Kode with Klossy Camp (2020). I was put into a team of three to work on this final project. This final project would be a website that would showcase all of the skills that we learned in the two weeks at camp and focused on a topic that the whole team was passionate about. We found that our shared passion was for the issue of climate change and how we can stop it. Thus, our website Combating Climate Change. With a lot of research, we found that there are not many websites that are solely dedicated to spreading awareness and providing education about climate change and how we can combat it. So we decided to create one with a focus on the effect of clean, renewable energy. Our tech stack includes GitHub, Repl.it, jQuery, HTML5, JavaScript, CSS, Figma, Google Maps Embed API, and Google My Maps. This project was collaborated on and created by Morgan Young, Sakina Muckadam, and Christina Moon. To view the features of our website click the ""see project"" link.
