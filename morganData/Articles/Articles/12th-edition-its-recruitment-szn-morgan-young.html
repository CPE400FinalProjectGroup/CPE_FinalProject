When you're choosing classes for the school year, keep in mind that classes and homework aren't the only thing you're going to have to manage. Also, if you know that you're going to have a job before the semester begins, try to make your class schedule as "compact" as possible. Basically, try to get classes that are back-to-back time-wise, so that you don't waste time in between. This is what I've repeatedly done for the last 7 semesters and it's worked out really well. </p><p><strong>2Ô∏è‚É£ </strong>Maximize every second that you have. </p><p>Now that you've created an optimized, efficient schedule, you've got to maximize every second that you have. We all have the same 24 hours in a day, but it always comes down to how we utilize the time that we have. Everybody's different and you've got to do what works for you. Personally, I have ADHD and lectures don't go well for me. I don't really retain much from professors talking at me, so I'm basically staring off into space during lectures. But instead of wasting time while sitting in class, I work. Sometimes I work on tasks from my job, homework, or more often than note, write content (I've published so many of my posts while in class LOL). </p><p><strong>3Ô∏è‚É£ </strong>Take adequate breaks and make time for non-work things.</p><p>If you've constantly got your head in your laptop, doing homework, working your job, or applying to jobs, you're going to lose your sanity; I guarantee it. Take a break every now and then! Enjoy a Saturday and binge a Netflix show if you want to. The bottom line: make some time for non-work things where you can simply relax and unwind. </p><p><strong>4Ô∏è‚É£ </strong>Get sleep and take care of yourself, first. </p><p>When you try to balance as much stuff as I do, it might be tempting to skip out on sleep and supplement with pre-workout, coffee, and energy drinks. Take it from someone who has been there and done that, DON'T DO IT. Caffeine can be very addicting, but the problem is that you can build up a tolerance. Before you know it, you're consuming 600 mg of caffeine a day and having caffeine crashes at 1 pm in class. I've since replaced caffeine bombs with exercise and 7-8 hours of sleep. Trust me, it's a lot better that way and a lot more sustainable. </p><p><strong>5Ô∏è‚É£ </strong>Accept the fact that you cannot be good at everything.</p><p>It's like the saying goes, "a jack-of-all-trades is a master of none, but still better than one." Personally, I don't believe in "staying in one lane" or putting all of my eggs in one basket. That's why I keep myself busy with work, fellowships, and projects. But one of the things I had to learn is that you cannot be 110% at everything. I have a 3.54 GPA, which is good, but probably not as good as it could be if I actually just focused on school. And I'm okay with that. I'm willing to let that area of my life give just a little bit so that I can succeed in other areas like my career. </p><hr><h3>Connect with Me!</h3><p>‚ú® Get in touch with me or book a 1:1 with me <a href="https://topmate.io/morganyoung" target="_blank">here</a>!</p><p>üîó Check out my <a href="https://www.morgan-ashleigh.com/" target="_blank">website</a>!</p><p>üí° <a href="https://morganyoung.gumroad.com/" target="_blank">Career Resources</a> from yours truly</p><p>üòÅ Don't forget to hit that Subscribe button and stay tuned for next week's edition!</p></div>
