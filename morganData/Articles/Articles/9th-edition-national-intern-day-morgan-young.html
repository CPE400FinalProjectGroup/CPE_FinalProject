Hopefully, the work you did as an intern is valuable and will be kept within the company to continue on with the corresponding project. But it's your responsibility to make sure that this work is accessible and your leadership knows where it's located. This could be a public/shared/common folder in SharePoint or Google Drive. In addition, it might be helpful to create some of your own onboarding materials, or "context" as I call it, for the next person handling your work. This could be as fancy as separate onboarding documentation or as simple as comments on a Word doc. </p><p>2Ô∏è‚É£ Make a directory of contacts you got while at the company.</p><p>Hopefully, you did lots of networking during your internship! But don't lose touch! Before you go, make an effort to get the contact information of colleagues, co-workers, leadership, mentors, etc. and store it in a personal system i.e. a Notion doc, an Excel spreadsheet, a folk form. Most companies also have internal directories of employees; make use of these systems to retrieve email addresses and phone numbers!</p><p>3Ô∏è‚É£ Go over your resume with a supervisor.</p><p>If you've followed my tips on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/morgan-a-young_internship-summerinternship-careergrowth-activity-7083188099731632129-p6CJ?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank">writing weekly executive summaries and recording achievements</a>, you've probably got plenty of new bullet points for your resume! BUT, you probably signed some sort of NDA or non-disclosure at the beginning of your internship (depending on the company). To make sure you don't violate this NDA, review your resume bullet points with a supervisor or a manager. They'll help you "anonymize" sensitive data and make sure everything in your resume is okay for external consumption. </p><p>4Ô∏è‚É£ Ask for feedback / performance evaluation. </p><p>Depending on the company, you may or may not have visibility to your performance evaluations. If you don't, it might be good to ask your manager for feedback! Ask them for feedback on your work, your presentations, etc. You can also take this time to ask them about future opportunities like extensions, return offers, and full-time conversions. But this isn't just limited to managers! You can also ask your supervisor, co-worker, mentor, etc. </p><p>5Ô∏è‚É£ Ask for recommendations on your LinkedIn!</p><p>If you got good feedback from your manager, supervisor, or co-worker, take it a step further! Ask them to write you a recommendation on your LinkedIn profile. If they say yes, you can make the process easier for them by going to their LinkedIn profile, clicking the "More" button, and selecting "Request a Recommendation." </p><div><hr></div><h3>ICYMI:</h3><p><em>a content roundup from LinkedIn's Top Voices ~ National Intern Day Edition!</em></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/morgan-a-young_nationalinternday-linkedintopvoices-earlycareers-activity-7090343336921677824-48Wa?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank">How I Landed my 1st Internship at my Dream Company</a> by yours truly </li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/morgan-a-young_things-you-should-be-doing-in-your-internship-activity-7085337015872851968-C5Ih?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank">8 Things You Should be Doing in your Internship</a> also by yours truly ü•∞</li><li><a target="_blank">AJ Eckstein</a>'s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/aaron-aj-eckstein_nationalinternday-activity-7090335446890676224-XqoY?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank">Untold Internship Secrets</a></li><li><a target="_blank">Travis Chen</a>'s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/travismchen_nationalinternday-internshiptips-professionaldevelopment-activity-7090345089310326785-w93o?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank">Letter to Summer 2023 Interns</a></li></ul><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Connect with Me!</strong></h3><p>‚ú® Get in touch with me or book a 1:1 with me <a href="https://topmate.io/morganyoung" target="_blank">here</a>!</p><p>üîó Check out my new <a href="https://www.morgan-ashleigh.com/" target="_blank">website</a>!</p><p>üí° <a href="https://morganyoung.gumroad.com/" target="_blank">Career Resources</a> from yours truly</p><p>üòÅ Don't forget to hit that Subscribe button and stay tuned for next week's edition!</p></div>
