I started with one project that was assigned to me and utilized the knowledge from that project for a governance-focused technical writing project. These two projects established me as the "go-to" intern for low-code development. In my third internship, I took a challenge to build something proprietary using low code as opposed to my manager finding an external vendor. I started with something basic and iterated 20 times until it was a complex innovation management software. This project was high-visibility, and, as a result, people started emailing me and approaching me to be on their project or build something proprietary for them. In other words, two projects turned into 7+.</p><p>2Ô∏è‚É£ Volunteer/make yourself available for stretch assignments. üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p><p>What even is a stretch assignment? It's a project, task, or assignment that typically doesn't fall within your scope of work, whether that's because it requires a different skill-set or from a completely different team or organization. How do you find these? Tell your manager and colleagues you're open to additional responsibilities or "stretch assignments." Some companies even have an internal board for posting stretch assignments. Not only will this add another point to your resume, but it will also impress your manager by showing you can take initiative. Last summer, I took a stretch assignment building an application for ESPN. The skill-set I used was similar to the one I used in my job, but I work for the Corporate organization of Disney (not ESPN). </p><p>3Ô∏è‚É£ Take on "+1s" - ex. BERGs, outreach programs, etc. ‚ûï</p><p>A "+1" is something that probably isn't related to your job. In my first internship with Disney, my "+1" was joining the Disney Influencer, Advocate &amp; Outreach program, which entailed hosting and speaking at career outreach events. I also had a lot of teammates who held board, chair, and coordinator positions in BERGs (Business Employee Resource Groups), organizing events and initiatives for Pride Month, AAPI Heritage Month, Veteran's Day etc. When I competed in the Accenture Innovation Challenge, my team had a mentor who was an actual consultant at Accenture. Being an AIC mentor wasn't part of her job description, rather it was a +1 she volunteered for. </p><p>4Ô∏è‚É£ Make sure you're communicating your achievements! üó£</p><p>That sentence is the more politically correct way of saying "shamelessly self-promote." Yes, seriously. In an internship [or a job], you could make the company $1M, but it won't matter unless people, especially your manager, know. That doesn't mean you don't have to shout your achievements from the rooftops. You can communicate and show off your achievements by bringing them up in your 1:1s or sending weekly executive summaries to your manager. </p><p>5Ô∏è‚É£ Create content and document your internship experience! ‚úçÔ∏è</p><p>Continuing off the last point, you can show off your accomplishments and work by creating content about your experiences! Obviously, that's how I got my start as a content creator and began the journey to becoming a LinkedIn Top Voice. I started writing about what I was learning, working on, and experiencing as a #DisneyIntern. Not only did this launch me into my content creator career, it build a brand and a reputation for me at Disney. Suddenly, a lot of people in the office knew who I was.</p><hr><h3>Connect with Me!</h3><p>‚ú® Get in touch with me or book a 1:1 with me <a href="https://topmate.io/morganyoung" target="_blank">here</a>!</p><p>üîó Check out my <a href="https://www.morgan-ashleigh.com/" target="_blank">website</a>!</p><p>üí° <a href="https://morganyoung.gumroad.com/" target="_blank">Career Resources</a> from yours truly</p><p>üòÅ Don't forget to hit that Subscribe button and stay tuned for next week's edition! </p><p></p></div>
