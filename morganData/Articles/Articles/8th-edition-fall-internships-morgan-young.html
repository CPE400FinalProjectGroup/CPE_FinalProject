The first step in navigating a fall internship is to get the offer. To learn how to land an internship extension for your current summer internship, check out <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/7th-edition-landing-internship-extensions-return-offers-morgan-young" target="_blank">last week's edition</a>, and to learn how to land a new opportunity, check out the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/5th-edition-landing-dream-internship-morgan-young?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_publishing_post_edit%3Bcp1FCdV9QRK4aMGvTEBDzw%3D%3D" target="_blank">fifth edition, "Landing the Dream Internship." </a></p><p>2Ô∏è‚É£ Figure out your capacity (full-time vs. part-time).</p><p>Depending on the employer and the offer type (new opportunity or extension offer), you may or may not have this choice. If you choose to go full-time, you're probably going to have to take the semester off or take a "co-op" semester if it's offered by your school. If you choose to go part-time, you might choose to continue being a full-time student or reduce your course load. My personal experience ~ I had the option to go part-time (20 hours per week) and I was able to maintain 17 academic credits (full-time student + part-time intern). I made this decision because I felt that I could handle it. Give this decision a lot of thought before you make it. </p><p>3Ô∏è‚É£ Negotiate your terms.</p><p>Again, it depends on your employer and offer type, but you may have room to negotiate some things! A couple of things you might want to negotiate for a fall internship include scheduling flexibility, work flexibility (remote/hybrid) or pre-planned days off. I negotiated for all 3! Mind you, I didn't have to negotiate that hard for the remote option, since it was still 2021 and I lived 462 miles away from the office. For scheduling flexibility, I wanted to fit my work schedule around my class schedule. The way it worked out, I went to school on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday (for 1 hour) and worked on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday (for the rest of the day). I also requested two weeks off in between my summer internship and fall extension so I could take a break and go to Disneyland üòÇ.</p><p>4Ô∏è‚É£ Don't forget to consider academic credit or scholarships, if applicable.</p><p>Whether you go part-time or full-time, you might want to receive academic credit for your internship. Keep in mind, academic credits incur a cost, which may or may not be covered by your employer. There's also certain rules and regulations around internships for academic credit, which is why I have elected to receive no academic credit for ANY of my five internships (total of 15 academic credits). Also, some students have scholarships that require you to keep a certain course load. I fall under this category. I have to maintain a minimum of 12 credits per semester ("full-time status") for both of my scholarships. I was able to continue my current course load due to the fact that I was remote and part-time (20 hours per week). But that may not be your situation. If you have to maintain a minimal amount of credits, you might be able to satisfy that requirement by receiving credits for your internship. You could also explore online class options that would allow you the flexibility to do on-site and/or full-time internships. </p><p>5Ô∏è‚É£ If you're full-time and on-site, get housing arrangements.</p><p>Some internship/co-op programs offer corporate housing or arrange housing. That's generally not the case though. Here are a few different options you can look at when looking for temporary housing (especially when re-locating):</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.furnishedfinder.com/" target="_blank">FurnishedFinder.com</a></li><li><a href="https://www.airbnb.com/a/Corporate-Housing" target="_blank">AirBnB - Corporate Housing</a></li><li>for CS majors &amp; techies ~ <em>cscareers.dev</em> discord; <strong>#roomate_matching</strong> channel ü§´</li><li>company intern group chats </li><li>local university student housing Facebook groups </li></ul><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Connect with Me!</strong></h3><p>‚ú® Get in touch with me or book a 1:1 with me <a href="https://topmate.io/morganyoung" target="_blank">here</a>!</p><p>üîó Check out my new <a href="https://www.morgan-ashleigh.com/" target="_blank">website</a>!</p><p>üí° <a href="https://morganyoung.gumroad.com/" target="_blank">Career Resources</a> from yours truly</p><p>üòÅ Don't forget to hit that Subscribe button and stay tuned for next week's edition!</p><p><br></p></div>
