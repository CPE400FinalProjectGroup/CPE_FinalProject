  <div><p><strong>Welcome back, Zoomers!</strong></p><p><strong>Zooming to the Top </strong>is THE place for Gen Zs aka "Zoomers" to get insider secrets, tips, tricks, and insights on rising to the top of their careers.</p><p>This is the SIXTH edition of Zooming to the Top and we're well under way into the Summer Intern SZN of 2023! Believe it or not [seriously, I sound like a broken record at this point], some companies are STILL recruiting summer interns for July start dates. To make the format of this edition's roundup a little smoother, the opportunities have been grouped by start date (summer '23, fall '23, academic year '23-'24). </p><p>And for the rising seniors, DON'T FORGET: the recruiting cycle for full-time jobs has already started!!

Apprentices couldn't earn wages during their apprenticeships and sometimes they even had to pay their guild master for the training. The term "intern" was coined around the 1920s in reference to medical students. However, it wasn't until recently that internships not only became the norm for college students, but a MUST. For most industries, companies expect entry-level candidates to have at least some internship experience, <strong><em>especially</em></strong> technology and finance. </p><p>Coming back to the history piece of this, I know that we say that internships are a "distant descendant" of medieval apprenticeships, but they haven't evolved that much. For unpaid internships, you won't be compensated AND you might even incur an expense if you're earning academic credits for your internship. Internships can count for 1-4 university credits and you have to pay tuition as normal for these credits. That's essentially paying for your internship. </p><p>2️⃣ <em>High school (&lt;18) vs. College (&gt;18)</em></p><p>This is where my perspective gets complicated. If you follow me and regularly read my content, you know I am vehemently against unpaid internships. But there is a bit of nuance to my opinion and perspective. The first one I'll discuss is being in high school vs. being in college. When you're in high school, you're typically under the age of 18 (for the majority of high school anyway). This is where things get complicated. There is a lot of legality and red tape around hiring anyone under the age of 18 for any reason. When I was working as a child actor, I had to go through a mountain of paperwork just to be allowed to work as a minor. It's no different for paid internships. This is why some employers don't pay high school interns and why some employers just don't hire high school interns. It can take significant legal resources to onboard an under 18 intern, which some smaller companies don't have. </p><p><strong><em>TL;DR </em></strong>If you're in high school and you've received an unpaid internship offer, ask yourself a few questions to figure out if it's truly right for you ~</p><ul><li>How much time are they requiring from me? ~ I wouldn't advise working 40 hours per week for an employer if they're not compensating you. This is a full-time job and should be paid as such (if this is the case). As a high school student, you should have time aside from your internship to do things you enjoy or even earn money through a part-time job (if you need to).  </li><li>Are the skills that I will learn relevant to what I want to pursue in the future? ~ If you're not going to get <strong><u>relevant</u></strong> experience for the future, I would recommend against taking an unpaid internship. If you're not getting compensated for the work you're doing, the entire value of the internship lies in the relevance of the projects you do and the skills you gain. </li><li>Does my employer value me and show this through non-monetary mediums? If your employer can't pay you, they might find other ways to show that they value you. These are called "non-monetary forms of compensation." This could look like them giving you a laptop to do work on/to keep, paying your way to a professional conference, free food (if you work in the office), or other in-kind benefits. </li><li>Will I get good items to put on my resume? ~ Again, if you're not getting paid, the internship will purely be a resume-building activity. </li></ul><p>3️⃣ <em>Internships vs. Fellowships &amp; Externships</em></p><p>I have never taken an unpaid internship; however, I have taken unpaid fellowships and considered unpaid externships. The major difference here is that the new, current standard for internships is "paid." It is standard for fellowships and externships to be unpaid (though this is not always the case - some are most definitely PAID). Some key differences &amp; similarities for internships vs. fellowships &amp; externships:</p><ul><li>Internships typically demand a considerable and regular time commitment i.e. 8-12 weeks, 20-40 hours (≤ 20 for Part-time and 40 for full-time) whereas fellowships &amp; externships typically require anywhere from a few hours per month to 10 hours per week (much lower commitment).</li><li>There's a bit less strictness with fellowships and externships - in other words, if you need to take a day off for family or for an occasion, or you have a pre-planned summer family vacation, it's not that big of a deal and you might not even have to ask for time off. </li><li>There's disproportionately more fellowship &amp; externship opportunities for high school students than internship opportunities - for the reasons I've mentioned above + the complications of compensation/legality of under 18 interns. </li><li>Internships, fellowships, and externships are all GREAT things for your resume; however, if you're not getting paid, I recommend fellowships and externships over internships for the sake of the required time commitment and establishing work-life balance as a high school student. </li></ul><p>4️⃣ <em>The Legality of Unpaid Internships</em></p><p>I'm not going to spend too much time on this one since I'm not a lawyer nor do I have any legal education (though I'll have to talk to my dad about this once he gets through his Case Law class 😂). However, I want to provide some resources for anyone who wants to dive deeper into the ever-looming question, "Are unpaid internships legal?" Check out this fact sheet from the US Department of Labor ➡️ <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/71-flsa-internships" target="_blank">Fact Sheet 71: Internship Programs Under The Fair Labor Standards Act</a>. </p><p>5️⃣ <em>My Conclusion</em></p><p>Ultimately, it's up to you whether or not you take an unpaid internship and I think it's important to consider all of the levels of nuance that I've discussed here in this article. It is my personal opinion that all internships <strong>should</strong> be paid and employers should value the work that you do as an intern. If you are a high school student, an unpaid internship could be beneficial to you depending on the non-monetary things you could get out of the internship. If you are a college student, I'd strongly recommend <strong>against</strong> taking an unpaid internship. Better alternatives include fellowships and externships as well as paid part-time jobs. </p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Connect with Me!</strong></h3><p>✨ Get in touch with me or book a 1:1 with me <a href="https://topmate.io/morganyoung" target="_blank">here</a>!</p><p>🔗 Check out my new <a href="https://www.morgan-ashleigh.com/" target="_blank">website</a>!</p><p>💡 <a href="https://morganyoung.gumroad.com/" target="_blank">Career Resources</a> from yours truly</p><p>😁 Don't forget to hit that Subscribe button and stay tuned for next week's edition!</p></div>
