My name is Morgan. By day, I'm a Computer Science & Engineering, and Entrepreneurship student, public speaker, and content creator. By night (more like afternoon), I'm a self-development addict, a health nut, a co-founder of the budding UNR Figure Skating Team, and aspiring entrepreneur!  👩🏻‍💻 I discovered my passion for technology when I took my first robotics class at nine years old. I have chased that passion since then with the help of programs like Microsoft DigiGirlz, UC Berkeley's Program Your Future, Girls Who Code, and Kode with Klossy.  👤 Along with my passion for technology, I've gradually realized my passion for people throughout my life. I am an introvert turned extrovert, and I fully realized how much I love people during my first semester of college. I'm an extremely social creature, and I love being able to help people.  ✨ Now I pursue my passion for both people and technology through technical management roles. My latest role has allowed me to learn and practice product management, as well as project management. What I've found is that I love being the bridge between people and the technology that they use. With that self-knowledge, my mission in life is to make people's lives a little easier or a little better by leveraging advancing technology.  🛠 What I'm Working on Right Now: 🎯 Building a community and partnering with brands to bring amazing experiences and resources to my audience 🎯 Teaching students & colleagues how to leverage LinkedIn for their job search & building their personal brand 🎯 Creating content that covers early career tips, college student things, and Gen Zers in the workforce  🎤 See the 'Volunteer' section for all of my speaking opportunities. Pro-bono for all nonprofits. Message me for speaking or press inquiries!  🌸 Fun Facts: 🎬 I was a child actor and auditioned for Disney Channel 7 years before becoming a #DisneyIntern. 📚 I’m a total bookworm! My favorite genres are fantasy, sci-fi, and personal development/self-help. 🏝 I love to travel! My last trip was to LA for Tech Week and my next trip is back to sunny LA for some Disney work 🤫! ⛸ I’m the Director of PR for UNR Figure Skating!
