Gina,Johnson,Salesforce,Senior Technical Recruiter,"Gina is one of the best recruiters in the business. My experience with her was in the summer 2023 recruiting cycle for the Salesforce APM Intern program, where she was managing my application and candidate journey. From the beginning to the end, I couldn’t have felt more supported throughout the process. Gina kept a regular, consistent pace of communicating with me even if she didn’t have an update for me. In between my interview rounds, she offered times to catch up to see how my interviewing experience went and prepare me for the next potential round. She is, by far, one of the most organized and diligent recruiters I’ve ever worked with. And for the record, I did not land the role. But I was even more impressed that she took the time to call and talk it over with me when I didn’t. Most of my experiences have been either getting ghosted or receiving a generic rejection email after an arduous interview process. But not with Gina. This was one of the few recruiting/interview cycles I’ve been through where I didn’t get the role but came out of it feeling improved, supported, and happy. Overall, Gina goes above and beyond to provide an exceptional candidate experience with a very empathetic and personal touch. ","05/28/23, 04:47 AM",
